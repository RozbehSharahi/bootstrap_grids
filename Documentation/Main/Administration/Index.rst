Import gridelements (old)
-------------------------

**Not required anymore**: The gridelements are defined in pageTS and loaded automatically.

If you prefer record based grid definitions the .t3d file with the gridelement records still exists and may be imported manually.

The file is located in the extension directory **Resources/Private/Import/**.
