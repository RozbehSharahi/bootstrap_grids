Configuration
=============

The row grid is not enabled by default now. It may be enabled in the extension configuration.

|img-extconf|

If you would like to use record based grid definitions and have the grid rendering assigned to uids (1-9) as in the 1.0.x versions, you may enable it in the extension configuration.

After enabling the option useOldRecordIds don't forget to include the additional static template.
